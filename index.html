            <p>
                Good morning!! I found some source code and inspo on someones account and wanted to try this out on you. It was supposed to be a happy birthday card but whateverrr.
                <br><br>

                Between seas, galaxies, moons, and stars, I was glad I stepped on the same land and stars as you. Im sure mochi, uni, and ocean (you released her to the wild TT) felt the same way.
